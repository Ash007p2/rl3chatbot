# rl3chatbot
A simple chatbot implemented with Python and RL3.

The idea is to implement a well-known Elize bot logic as a core, and then build a specialized bot on top of it. Intent detection and NER will be implemented in RL3. Answer generation logic will be
implemented in Python 3, and will be based on intents and entities detected.
